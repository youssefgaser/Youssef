<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, there! This is Yousef Gaser.
   I am known with my intelligence and loyalty.
   I am a man who struggles to be extremely successfull and rich. 
   I've a lot of passions and I will tell the most passions I love. 
   I will start with the languages. 
   English is the language I used most of the time and I would like to improve my English to C1 level according to CEFR.
   And the second language is Russian.
   Yess!! Actually I really love Russian and I've started learning it, 
   but unfortunately I am at the begging and I cant's even open a simple conversation in Russian. 
   and now let's move on to the 3rd language which is Spanish. Ok, my level here as same as Russian LOL!. 
   Here we go, the language that I've chosen in my High School  which is German. 
   I actually can read a simple paragraph and answer its questions. 
   Are you still here? Wow that's great! So, now let's tell you guys about the programming. 
   I have 2 programming languages. I have HTML and CSS and I'm gonna learn JAVASCRIPT and others. 
   I take a lot of courses about several things. Soon I will be one of the most successfull people like Steve Jobs.</p>
